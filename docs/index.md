# Welcome to my notes on Programming and Software

This is a collection of my notes about Programming languages and tools
(code formatters, linters, documentation, Makefiles) and software packages.

These notes were originally a large number of text files, but have been 
collected in a single repository and formatted using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).
